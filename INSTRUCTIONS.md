# ðŸŽ® Guessing Game

Welcome, Agent, to **Guessing Game**. This project challenges you to build a command-line number guessing game who will generate a random number and user have to guess it. Your mission, should you choose to accept it , is to construct a Javascript script that executes these tasks with maximum efficiency and clarity. The clock is tickingâ€”you have 15 minutes before this project self-destructs.

## ðŸš€ Mission Objectives

1. **Display the Rules**: The system will clearly show the rules of the game, including the range of numbers (between 1 and 100).
2. **Request User Input**: Prompt the player to input their guess.
3. **Validate Input**: Ensure the userâ€™s guess is a valid number within the acceptable range. If the input is invalid, display an error and ask for another guess.
4. **Hint the Player**: Inform the player if their guess is too high or too low, and allow them to guess again.
5. **Keep Track of Attempts**: Continue prompting the user for guesses until they correctly guess the number.
6. **Victory and Feedback**: Once the correct number is guessed, display the number of attempts taken and congratulate the player.
7. **Performance**: Optimize your solution for readability and performance.

## ðŸ›  Final Mission

Your final task, Agent, is to optimize the solution for both **readability** and **performance**. Code must be clean, concise, and efficient to ensure the operation's success.

This message will self-destruct in 10 minutes. Good luck, Agent.
