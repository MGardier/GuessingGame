# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! In this project, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess it by entering your number in the console. The system will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## 🎯 Game Objective

The goal is to guess the randomly generated number using as few attempts as possible. After each guess, you will be told if your number is too high or too low until you find the correct answer.

## 🚀 Game Rules

2. You need to guess this number.
3. Each time you enter a number, the system will tell you if it is **too high** or **too low**.
